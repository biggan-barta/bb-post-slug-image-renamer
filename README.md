# Post Slug Image Renamer

A WordPress plugin that automatically renames uploaded images with the post slug when uploading from the post editor, while leaving Media Library uploads unchanged.

## Description

Post Slug Image Renamer helps organize your WordPress media files by automatically renaming images based on the post slug when they are uploaded through the post editor (featured images, content images, etc.). This makes your media files more organized and SEO-friendly.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Smart Detection**: Only renames images uploaded from post editor
- ✅ **Media Library Safe**: Leaves direct Media Library uploads unchanged
- ✅ **SEO Friendly**: Uses post slug as filename base
- ✅ **Conflict Prevention**: Adds random suffixes to prevent filename conflicts
- ✅ **Configurable**: Multiple settings to customize behavior
- ✅ **Statistics**: Track renamed files and view statistics
- ✅ **Multi Post Type**: Support for posts, pages, and custom post types

## How It Works

1. **Post Editor Uploads**: When you upload images through the post editor (featured image, insert media, etc.), they get renamed with the post slug
2. **Media Library Uploads**: Direct uploads to the Media Library keep their original filenames
3. **Filename Format**: `post-slug-random-suffix.extension`
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Random suffixes prevent filename conflicts

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/post-slug-image-renamer/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure settings in 'Image Renamer' menu in WordPress admin

## Settings

### General Settings

- With timestamp: `my-awesome-blog-post-1640995200-abc123.jpg`
